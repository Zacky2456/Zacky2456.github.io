    At the game's outset, the player character, the Knight, arrives in Dirtmouth, a small town above Hallownest's ruins, seeking to venture within. As it journeys through the forgotten kingdom, the Knight encounters the remnants of Hallownest's former residents and other creatures, who are slowly being overcome by the Infection. It encounters Hornet, the "protector" of Hallownest's ruins, who attempts to stop the Knight's quest on multiple occasions. Through learning the history of Hallownest on its journey, the Knight discovers that it itself is a failed Vessel. It becomes clear that the Pale King's attempt at sealing away the Infection using the Hollow Knight did not work and would soon release the full power of the Infection to consume all of the remaining inhabitants of Hallownest.

    Through dialogue with certain characters as well as cutscenes, the Knight receives insight into the origin of the Infection and itself. In ancient times, the bugs of Hallownest worshiped a higher being - a primordial, god-like creature - called the Radiance, a moth whose mere presence could sway the denizens of Hallownest to mindless obedience. However, another higher being, the Wyrm, arrived, and transformed into the Pale King in order to rule Hallownest. He expanded the minds of the bugs of Hallownest, civilizing them, and convinced the moth tribe to forget the Radiance, locking her away. The Pale King went on to construct a great kingdom, but the Radiance fought back by entering his subjects' dreams and driving them to madness, an affliction called the Infection. In an attempt to contain the spreading Infection, the Pale King used the power of Void, a type of living darkness, to create the Vessels - beings that lack a mind and will beyond what is imprinted on them. After many attempts, he created a suitable Vessel, the Hollow Knight, and used it to contain the Infection. The Hollow Knight was placed within the Black Egg Temple and sealed by three powerful elder bugs, the Dreamers, to be locked away forever.

    Depending on the player's actions, Hollow Knight has multiple endings. In the first ending, "Hollow Knight", the player defeats the Hollow Knight and takes its place. As chains hold the Knight in place, the Temple is sealed once again, though the Infection still survives. The second ending, "Sealed Siblings", occurs if the player collects the Void Heart charm before fighting the Hollow Knight. Halfway through the battle, Hornet arrives to offer assistance and briefly holds the Hollow Knight at bay. Choosing to continue fighting normally causes her to be knocked unconscious. The ending then plays out like the first, except Hornet, sealed in with the player, becomes the new Dreamer, sealing the Temple door.

    The third ending, "Dream No More", occurs if the player collects the Void Heart and uses the Awakened Dream Nail ability to enter the Hollow Knight's mind when Hornet arrives to help. Here, the player challenges the Radiance. With the power of the Void Heart, the Knight commands the forces of the Void, with the aid of the Hollow Knight and the shades (ghosts) of the failed Vessels, to consume the Radiance, and destroy the Infection. As the darkness from the Temple fades, Hornet awakens to find the chamber empty, except for the player Knight's broken and empty shell.
